# XSS Catcher
XSS Catcher is a simple application that facilitates blind Cross-Site Scripting attacks and attacks that aim to gather data (e.g. cookies, session/local storage, screenshots, etc.). 
## Features
* Generates simple customizable XSS payloads
* Sends email alerts when a new XSS is caught
* The destination email is configured per client to better fit an environment where different pentesters don't necessarily work on the same tests
* Separates the gathered data by clients
* Multi-user with administrative and low privilege users
* Stores information about the triggered XSS payloads like User-Agent, source IP address, timestamp, etc.
* Allows capture of cookies, local storage, session storage and any other specified parameters
* Payload can be customized by the users as he pleases. Simply pass your data in the query string or POST body and the application will catch it! 
* Leverages [html2canvas](https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas) and [fingerprintjs2](https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2)
* Captures the full DOM so you can easily know where the payload triggered
* Granular deletion of captured data
* Uses db initialisation scripts with Flask-Migrate, so using an alternative database only requires minor modifications of the docker-compose.yml file
## Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/daxAKAhackerman/XSS-Catcher.git
cd XSS-Catcher
docker-compose up -d
```
## Update
**Important:** The early versions of XSS Catcher got a lot of DB models modifications and Flask-Migrate was badly used. As such, if you were using versions before commit 44431224885a5c62d182177123f79b1a8f7f0342 (Aug 9, 2020 which is pretty much before anybody used the tool at all), updating XSS Catcher will require deletion of the docker volume associated with the database (basically reverting to factory defaults) resulting in the loss of the data stored in the software. 
```bash
git pull
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```
## First login
* Default credentials to connect to the Web interface are **admin:xss**
* Default Web port is **8888**
## *JavaScript mixed content error*
*In order to avoid JavaScript mixed content errors when the XSS payload is triggered, it is highly recommended to put XSS Catcher behind a reverse proxy providing valid TLS certificates.*
